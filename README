DESCRIPTION
    This module is a logs formater . It parses lemonldap logs into flat file
    with separator .

    The lemonldap framework is a web SSO server apache . This log is like :


 LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" \"%{forensic-id}n\" %v"

 the %v (virtual host name ) at the end of line is the only difference with combined format apache log


Methods
  new->(file => /path_file) ;
     Path of log file . This file MUST exits . 
 
  can_field () ;
     return the list of supported field  

  get_field (header => 1,
                  fields => [f1,F2..] );
     return  a string with fields or names of colomns (no both) .  
     If fields is ometted  , return a list like can_field

  get_label (header => 1,
                  fields => [f1,F2..] );
     Like get_field but uses symbolics names (labels) instead  names

  set_label (
                  'fieldname' => 'myname');
     Set symbolic name for field .

  time and date
    A parser MUST return date and time (format aaaammjj and hhmmss ) but you
    can get only aaaa or mm or dd by this syntax : date:aaaa date:mm date:dd

     and so for time : time:hh time:mm time:se
